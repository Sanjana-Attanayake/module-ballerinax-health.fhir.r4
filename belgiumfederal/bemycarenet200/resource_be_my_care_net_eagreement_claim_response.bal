# FHIR BeMyCareNetEagreementClaimResponse resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + insurance - Financial instruments for reimbursement for the health care products and services specified on the claim.
# + request - Original request resource reference.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + use - A code to indicate whether the nature of the request is: to request adjudication of products and services previously rendered; or requesting authorization and adjudication for provision in the future; or requesting the non-binding adjudication of the listed products and services which could be provided in the future.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + payeeType - Type of Party to be reimbursed: subscriber, provider, other.
# + preAuthRef - Reference from the Insurer which is used in later communications which refers to this adjudication.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + 'error - Errors encountered during the processing of the adjudication.
# + 'type - A finer grained suite of claim type codes which may convey additional information such as Inpatient vs Outpatient and/or a specialty service.
# + processNote - A note that describes or explains adjudication results in a human readable form.
# + adjudication - The adjudication results which are presented at the header level rather than at the line-item or add-item levels.
# + addItem - The first-tier service adjudications for payor added product or service lines.
# + total - Categorized monetary totals for the adjudication.
# + fundsReserve - A code, used only on a response to a preauthorization, to indicate whether the benefits payable have been reserved and for whom.
# + insurer - The party responsible for authorization, adjudication and reimbursement.
# + patient - The party to whom the professional services and/or products have been supplied or are being considered and for whom actual for facast reimbursement is sought.
# + communicationRequest - Request for additional supporting or authorizing information.
# + payment - Payment details for the adjudication of the claim.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + outcome - The outcome of the claim, predetermination, or preauthorization processing.
# + identifier - A unique identifier assigned to this claim response.
# + item - A claim line. Either a simple (a product or service) or a 'group' of details which can also be a simple items or groups of sub-details.
# + preAuthPeriod - The time frame during which this authorization is effective.
# + formCode - A code for the form to be used for printing the content.
# + created - The date this resource was created.
# + requestor - The provider which is responsible for the claim, predetermination or preauthorization.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + disposition - A human readable description of the status of the adjudication.
# + form - The actual form, by reference or inclusion, for printing the content or an EOB.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + subType - A finer grained suite of claim type codes which may convey additional information such as Inpatient vs Outpatient and/or a specialty service.
# + status - The status of the resource instance.

# + reference - A reference to a location at which the other resource is found. The reference may be a relative reference, in which case it is relative to the service base URL, or an absolute URL that resolves to the location where the resource is found. The reference may be version specific or not. If the reference is not to a FHIR RESTful server, then it should be assumed to be version specific.

There is no requirement that a Reference.identifier point to something that is actually exposed as a FHIR instance, but it SHALL point to a business concept that would be expected to be exposed as a FHIR instance, and that instance would need to be of a FHIR resource type allowed by the reference.

# FHIR BeMyCareNetEagreementClaimResponseMeta datatype record.

# + lastUpdated - When the resource last changed - e.g. when the version changed.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + security - Security labels applied to this resource. These tags connect specific resources to the overall security policy and infrastructure.
# + versionId - The version specific identifier, as it appears in the version portion of the URL. This value changes when the resource is created, updated, or deleted.
# + profile - A list of profiles (references to [StructureDefinition](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/structuredefinition.html#) resources) that this resource claims to conform to. The URL is a reference to [StructureDefinition.url](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/structuredefinition-definitions.html#StructureDefinition.url).
# + id - Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
# + 'source - A uri that identifies the source system of the resource. This provides a minimal amount of [Provenance](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/provenance.html#) information that can be used to track or differentiate the source of information in the resource. The source may identify another FHIR server, document, message, database, etc.
# + tag - Tags applied to this resource. Tags are intended to be used to identify and relate resources to process and workflow, and applications are not required to consider the tags when interpreting the meaning of a resource.
