# FHIR BeMyCareNetEagreementClaim resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + insurance - Financial instruments for reimbursement for the health care products and services specified on the claim.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + use - A code to indicate whether the nature of the request is: to request adjudication of products and services previously rendered; or requesting authorization and adjudication for provision in the future; or requesting the non-binding adjudication of the listed products and services which could be provided in the future.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + 'type - The category of claim, e.g. oral, pharmacy, vision, institutional, professional.
# + accident - Details of an accident which resulted in injuries which required the products and services listed in the claim.
# + payee - The party to be reimbursed for cost of the products and services according to the terms of the policy.
# + total - The total value of the all the items in the claim.
# + related - Other claims which are related to this claim such as prior submissions or claims for related services or for the same event.
# + supportingInfo - Additional information codes regarding exceptions, special considerations, the condition, situation, prior or concurrent issues.
# + fundsReserve - A code to indicate whether and for whom funds are to be reserved for future claims.
# + provider - The provider which is responsible for the claim, predetermination or preauthorization.
# + insurer - The Insurer who is target of the request.
# + patient - The party to whom the professional services and/or products have been supplied or are being considered and for whom actual or forecast reimbursement is sought.
# + enterer - Individual who created the claim, predetermination or preauthorization.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + careTeam - The members of the team who provided the products and services.
# + identifier - A unique identifier assigned to this claim.
# + item - A claim line. Either a simple product or service or a 'group' of details which can each be a simple items or groups of sub-details.
# + created - The date this resource was created.
# + diagnosis - Information about diagnoses relevant to the claim items.
# + originalPrescription - Original prescription which has been superseded by this prescription to support the dispensing of pharmacy services, medications or products.
# + procedure - Procedures performed on the patient relevant to the billing items with the claim.
# + priority - The provider-required urgency of processing the request. Typical values include: stat, routine deferred.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + referral - A reference to a referral resource.
# + prescription - Prescription to support the dispensing of pharmacy, device or vision products.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + billablePeriod - The period for which charges are being submitted.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + subType - A finer grained suite of claim type codes which may convey additional information such as Inpatient vs Outpatient and/or a specialty service.
# + facility - Facility where the services were provided.
# + status - The status of the resource instance.

# + system - The identification of the code system that defines the meaning of the symbol in the code.
# + userSelected - Indicates that this coding was chosen by a user directly - e.g. off a pick list of available items (codes or displays).
# + display - A representation of the meaning of the code in the system, following the rules of the system.
# + id - Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
# + 'version - The version of the code system which was used when choosing this code. Note that a well-maintained code system does not need the version reported, because the meaning of codes is consistent across versions. However this cannot consistently be assured, and when the meaning is not guaranteed to be consistent, the version SHOULD be exchanged.

# + reference - A reference to a location at which the other resource is found. The reference may be a relative reference, in which case it is relative to the service base URL, or an absolute URL that resolves to the location where the resource is found. The reference may be version specific or not. If the reference is not to a FHIR RESTful server, then it should be assumed to be version specific. Internal fragment references (start with '#') refer to contained resources.
# + identifier - An identifier for the target resource. This is used when there is no way to reference the other resource directly, either because the entity it represents is not available through a FHIR server, or because there is no way for the author of the resource to convert a known identifier to an actual location. There is no requirement that a Reference.identifier point to something that is actually exposed as a FHIR instance, but it SHALL point to a business concept that would be expected to be exposed as a FHIR instance, and that instance would need to be of a FHIR resource type allowed by the reference.

To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + display - Plain text narrative that identifies the resource in addition to the resource reference.

# + 'type - The expected type of the target of the reference. If both Reference.type and Reference.reference are populated and Reference.reference is a FHIR URL, both SHALL be consistent. The type is the Canonical URL of Resource Definition that is the type this reference refers to. References are URLs that are relative to http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/ e.g. 'Patient' is a reference to http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient. Absolute URLs are only allowed for logical models (and can only be used in references in logical models, not resources).

#
# + reference - A reference to a location at which the other resource is found. The reference may be a relative reference, in which case it is relative to the service base URL, or an absolute URL that resolves to the location where the resource is found. The reference may be version specific or not. If the reference is not to a FHIR RESTful server, then it should be assumed to be version specific. Internal fragment references (start with '#') refer to contained resources.
# + identifier - An identifier for the target resource. This is used when there is no way to reference the other resource directly, either because the entity it represents is not available through a FHIR server, or because there is no way for the author of the resource to convert a known identifier to an actual location. There is no requirement that a Reference.identifier point to something that is actually exposed as a FHIR instance, but it SHALL point to a business concept that would be expected to be exposed as a FHIR instance, and that instance would need to be of a FHIR resource type allowed by the reference.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + display - Plain text narrative that identifies the resource in addition to the resource reference.
# + id - Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
# + 'type - The expected type of the target of the reference. If both Reference.type and Reference.reference are populated and Reference.reference is a FHIR URL, both SHALL be consistent. The type is the Canonical URL of Resource Definition that is the type this reference refers to. References are URLs that are relative to http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/ e.g. 'Patient' is a reference to http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient. Absolute URLs are only allowed for logical models (and can only be used in references in logical models, not resources).

Internal fragment references (start with '#') refer to contained resources.
# + identifier - An identifier for the target resource. This is used when there is no way to reference the other resource directly, either because the entity it represents is not available through a FHIR server, or because there is no way for the author of the resource to convert a known identifier to an actual location. There is no requirement that a Reference.identifier point to something that is actually exposed as a FHIR instance, but it SHALL point to a business concept that would be expected to be exposed as a FHIR instance, and that instance would need to be of a FHIR resource type allowed by the reference.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + display - Plain text narrative that identifies the resource in addition to the resource reference.
# + id - Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
# + 'type - The expected type of the target of the reference. If both Reference.type and Reference.reference are populated and Reference.reference is a FHIR URL, both SHALL be consistent. The type is the Canonical URL of Resource Definition that is the type this reference refers to. References are URLs that are relative to http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/ e.g. 'Patient' is a reference to http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient. Absolute URLs are only allowed for logical models (and can only be used in references in logical models, not resources).
